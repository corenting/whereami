# whereami

whereami is a simple console application to get your location using [ipapi.co](https://ipapi.co/). By default, it displays the city, country, latitude, and longitude.
For basic usage, see ```whereami -h```.

# Compilation and installation

You need to install [nim](https://nim-lang.org/install.html) then you can do a make build-release at the root of the repository to generate the `whereami` binary.
